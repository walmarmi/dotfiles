# Feedback on Task 4:


- I fixed Task 2 feedback by adding another alias into `.bash_aliases` and closed the issue.

## Summary of Repository Contents:

- This repository has instructions on how to configure a Linux environment like having my own Vim configs, bash aliases, and scripts to install systems. 
## Folders:
- `vim-config`: This folder has the script that installs Vim plugins using Vundle and color schemes.
- `homefiles`: This folder has the script that controls my bash aliases that I've personally chosen and can link to the home directory. It's been written to be easy to update and add new aliases.
- `sys-installs`: This folder has the script that installs a software that I've chosen, which is AWS CLI, with its dependencies and security checks like if apt is installed and root.

## How to Clone?:
- To clone: `git clone git@github.com:walmarmi/dotfiles.git`
- Enter directory: `cd dotfiles`

## Possible Improvements:
- A possible improvement could be to re-write the scripts to make them more simplified rather than formal and proper. It could help make it look more clean and also, make more aliases and install more software.
