## ZFS Filesystem Research

**What OS is it compatible with?**
- It is available and compatible with Linux distros like Ubuntu or Debian through OpenZFS.

**What is it for?**
- Its purpose is to act as a powerful file system that can manage a lot of data and protect its integrity. It's good with virtualization and server usage.

**How does it store data? Objects? Files?**
- It is designed to run on a single server with lots of storage drives (zpools) and it's made up of more virtual devices that it manages as a single identity. A user can add more storage drives to the pool if needed but they typically support large file sizes.

**How much data can it store?**
- It can handle up to 256 quadrillion zettabytes of data and each file can be up to 16 exabytes. The only limitation is the hardware.

**Is there something special about ability to use?**
- It requires specific hardware and high-quality equipment like RAM to prevent data corruption. You can use enterprise class SSD but there is no other official special requirements.

**Is there a license? Free? Pay?**
- ZFS is licensed under the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) and it is a free and open-source software.
